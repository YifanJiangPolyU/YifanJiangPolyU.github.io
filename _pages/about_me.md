<hr>

I am a passionate mechanical engineer with an interest in robotics, automation, and control. I have rich experience in designing and implementing automation systems, in motor and motion control, in mechanical design, as well as in programming.

I received my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and am pursuing my MSc in Robotics Systems and Control, at ETH Zurich. ETH brings me close to the world's most innovative and pioneering researchers in robotics and control, a great opportunity for me to learn and to train myself. I am really looking forward to the challenges!
