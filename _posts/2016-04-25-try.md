Hey guys. I am trying to construct a personal homepage, and this is my very first post. GitHub provids a really convenient place to host my homepage, and Jekyll is making the development easy. 

Building a homepage requires consistent efforts. I will try to add interesting things to it bit by bit, and hopefully one day this homepage will become lively and interesting.
