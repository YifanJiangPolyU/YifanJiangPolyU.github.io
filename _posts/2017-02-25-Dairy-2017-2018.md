## Sep 2017
An interesting jorney has ended, and another one must start. Having finished the internship at Maxon Motor, it's time to go back to school and be academic again :)

About the internship, there is so much to love about it. I've got a lovely workplace, friendly and helpful colleagues, and a ton of interesting motors to work with. Now I've really got to know motors and drivers as well as my fingers, and my German did improve a lot. Not to mention that at the end of the job my colleagues gave me the most special gift I've ever received! Can't love it more.

Worth mentioning, I've also started a project of my own, to develop a motor control platform. The target is to develop a controller for 3-phase PMSM, capable of executing current, speed, and position control. It will be able to control a series elastic actuator (SEA). Development has already started on a development kit, and the design of in-house hardware platform is underway. Hopefully a full solution can be turned out next year.

Back in school, still a ton of work is waiting for me. A few courses, my small thesis, and finding a job. The small thesis is particularly interesting for me. It's about the modeling and control of a series elastic actuator (SEA), which is a special type of motor that's particularly useful for robots that have to interact safely with human. Given the boom in cobot market that everybody envisions, SEA is a technology with big potentials. Really excited to work on it!

End of February is the begining of a new journey! Last December I got an offer for an internship at the world-famous Maxon Motor AG! Excited for quite a while, and I'm soon going to start it! Really like the company's nice location and huge lab, dream of all engineers~.

My part-time job at RSL has also come to an end. Must say it's a nice experience, in which I learned a ton of things about electronics, system integration, team working, and much more. The people are supper nice and supportive, a great part of the job. Although it's a bit stressful sometimes, it's not too bad, and I'm happy in the end. Hope to do my semester project or thesis with them, would be a great option!

Have been doing a part-time job at ETH's famous Robotic System Lab (RSL) for a few months, a fantastic experience! RSL is among the world's best labs that study quadrupedal robots, or "robotic dogs" as I like call them. It's really exciting to see it walk and jump. Digging deep into the low-level control systems for the robot is also full of fun.
