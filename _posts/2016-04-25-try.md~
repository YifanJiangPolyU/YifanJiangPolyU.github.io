Hey guys. I am trying to construct a personal homepage, and this is my very first post. GitHub provids a really convenient place to host my homepage, and Jekyll is making the development easy. 

Building a homepage requires consistent efforts. I will try to add interesting things to it bit by bit, and hopefully one day this homepage will become lively and interesting.

Don't be surprised to see posts earlier than this "First Post", because when I move old stuff into this website, I'll keep the original date.
