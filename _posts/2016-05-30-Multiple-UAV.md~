This project is my undergraduate final year project, and I wrote my undergraduate thesis out of it. Hopefully this short article will give you a brief idea about what I've done. 

## The Idea

<strong>Why do we need radio communication ?</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

If your UAV goes out for a mission, you want to make sure that you can contact the UAV at any time, to send commands to it, and to know what it is doing. There are two reasons for this. The first one is also the most obvious: if you cannot even contact your UAV, how can you do the mission with it? The second one is, if you lose contact with your UAV, your UAV may do unexpected actions without you knowing it, such actions can damage properties, and can ever hurt or kill somebody.

The choice of radio over other technologies such as WiFi or 3G/4G mobile network is made for 2 reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Radio has longer range than WiFi </li>
  <li>Radio has shorter (and more predictable) delay than 3G/4G </li>
</ul>

Although radio generally has lower data rates.

<strong>Why relaying radio communication ?</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

If your UAV does a mission in areas where you cannot directly, does it mean you have to abort the mission? With traditional UAV systems, yes. But with radio communication relay, NO! With the help of radio communication relay, the UAV can fly into areas where direct radio communication with you is blocked.

This idea is illustrated in Fig.1.

<strong>Others Circuits</strong>

The amplifier also features a number of other circuits:

1. A simple in-rush current limiter (ICL) circuit, to slow down the charging process of power supply capacitors on power-up (Fig.3).
2. A manual-controlled speaker protection circuit, protecting the speakers from the start-up transients. The speakers are simply disconnected from amplifier output when the amplifier is powering up. After full power-up, the speakers are re-connected. This is realized using 2 relays, which are in turn controlled manually, using a switch (Fig.4).
3. A potentiometer for volume adjustment. It in fact builds 2 potentiometers on the same axis, allowing volume of both Left and Right channels to be adjusted equally. On the same axis there is also a rotary switch, which I use to control the speaker protection circuit.

The working principle of the ICL circuit is simple. As shown in Fig.3, on power-up, the relay SW4 is in OFF state, and AC current has to flow through the 56-ohm resistor R-ICL, which limits the charging current of the power supply capacitors. When the power supply output voltage rises to a level (around 12V), SW4 is activated (into ON state), short-connecting R-ICL. The power supply then finishes charging, and no current flows through R-ICL in normal amplifier operation. The 2 terminals, V-IN and PE1, are used to sense the power-supply output voltage. With the ICL circuit, the power supply fully starts up in around 8 seconds.

<strong>The PCBs</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Fig.5 and Fig.6 shows the PCB layouts of the amplifier circuit and power supply circuit. I quickly sketched them using Eagle, and am not sure whether everything is perfect. A few useful guidelines in the amplifier circuit PCB layout:
<ul>
  <li> Separate small-signal (audio input) and large-signal (amplifier power supply and output) GND. The 2 joins together only at a single point. </li>
  <li> Use star-grounding whenever possible. </li>
  <li> Try not to let signal and power paths cross one another in different layers, to minimise cross-coupling of noise (in fact I tried to layout all the traces in the same layer). </li>
</ul>
