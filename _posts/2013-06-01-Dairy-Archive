## 2016
Travelling to Dawson city in Canada, a small town that took shape in early the 20th century because of the famous gold rush. Although it still produces some gold today, the town has almost lost its past glories. Glad to have found this nice slide rule in an antique shop in Dawson. I've wanted to own a slide rule for a long time. This little piece of history brings me back to the days before calculators, a deep emotional connection.

## 2014
Travelled to probably the most mysterious country in the world, Turkey. Previously only existed in stories and fairy tales, being so close to it made me feel unreal.

Being in Istanbul itself is like being in fairy tale: the churches and mosques, the calls for prayer from minarets, the old streets and dessert shops, everything seems frozen back in time, just as they were hundreds (or thousands) of years ago. History makes this city romantic, maybe even dog and cat can fall in love~

In Turkey there are many ducks, and strangely people don't eat them. Instead they are pretty generously fed (in an unhealthy diet though). Like in Pamukkale, people enjoy feeding ducks with bread.

## 2013
My first time in Canada, everything seemed so friendly to me. In the morning of my first day at Montreal, I saw some surprisingly beautiful patterns of frozen moisture, right on the window! Squirrels seem to like me as well, or did this one mistook my leg for a tree?
