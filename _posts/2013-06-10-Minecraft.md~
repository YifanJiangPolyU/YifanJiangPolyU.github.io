I'm not a game person, and I rarely play games. However, there's one game to which I'm particularly addicted: Minecraft!!! 

Minecraft is a game which allows you to build things in it, using pre-defined blocks. There are so many types of blocks and so many ways to combine them that there is virtually no limit on what you can build: houses, gardens, weapons, trains, and even computers! Minecraft has so many interesting aspects, find out by yourself at <a href="https://minecraft.net/">their homepage</a>!

At some points, I noticed how interesting it is to construct logic circuits in minecraft. After some experiments, I build my first logic gate! (Fig.1) However, my own design is too bulky, so I just adopted logic gates provided in Minecraft's official Wiki. 

Fig.2 shows a 8-bit binary adder, and Fig.3 shows a 4-bit binary multiplier, both "designed in-house". I had a plan to build a simple functioning calculator, but never had time to complete it.
