A dairy-like record of interesting moments in my life~ I'll keep updating ~

## Feb 2017
End of February is the begining of a new journey! Last December I got an offer for an internship at the world-famous Maxon Motor AG! Excited for quite a while, and I'm soon going to start it! Really like the company's nice location and huge lab, dream of all engineers~.

My part-time job at RSL has also come to an end. Must say it's a nice experience, in which I learned a ton of things about electronics, system integration, team working, and much more. The people are supper nice and supportive, a great part of the job. Although it's a bit stressful sometimes, it's not too bad, and I'm happy in the end. Hope to do my semester project or thesis with them, would be a great option!

## Jan 2017
Have been doing a part-time job at ETH's famous Robotic System Lab (RSL) for a few months, a fantastic experience! RSL is among the world's best labs that study quadrupedal robots, or "robotic dogs" as I like call them. It's really exciting to see it walk and jump. Digging deep into the low-level control systems for the robot is also full of fun.
