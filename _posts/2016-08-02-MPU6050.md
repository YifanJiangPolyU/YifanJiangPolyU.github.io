<a href="https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/">MPU6050</a>
is a low-cost IMU sensor, which provides 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular
velocity measurements (6 DOF in total). This sensor is really handy when it
comes to implementing things like wearable devices and drones. I got an
evaluation module of this sensor, and decided to build a very simple interface
to it using Arduino. Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/YifanJiangPolyU/MPU6050">https://github.com/YifanJiangPolyU/MPU6050</a>

A video showing how it works:

MPU6050 has build-in ADC and is capable of outputting readings digitally via a
I2C interface. In this interface, a Arduino Nano, which has a 8MHz 8-bit MCU, is
used as the I2C master. The Arduino reads measurements from MPU6050 cyclically,
and estimates the pose of the sensor, represented as Euler angles, using
a Kalman filter.

The estimated Euler angles are then transmitted to the PC via serial port (i.e.
UART). On the PC side, a python script reads the pose data and visualizes it in
real time.

The current implementation has a number of problems, but improvements are also easy to implement.

1. The 8-bit MCU is not powerful enough to execute pose estimation.
2. Delay is sever, because of inadequate processing power of the MCU.
3. Communication protocol between Arduino and PC is too primitive. Better protocol can be used to enable data integrity checking and miss data detection.
